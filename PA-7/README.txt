Programming Assignment #7

To run the code, use the makefile to compile.

Once this is done, in a terminal window run:

    ./dataserver -p (port #)

Once that program is running, you run the following command:

    ./client -n 10000 -b 300 -i n -h localhost -p (port #)

NOTE: the port # has to be the same in both commands
